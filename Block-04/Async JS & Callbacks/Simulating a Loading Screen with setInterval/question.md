ðŸ§© SECTION 1: ðŸ“Œ PROBLEM STATEMENT
=========================================

Problem Statement:
Create a JavaScript program that simulates a loading screen using setInterval. The program should:

Start by logging "Loading..." every 1 second.
After 5 seconds, stop the loading messages and log "Loaded successfully!".
Use setInterval to repeat the loading message and clearInterval to stop it.

ðŸ§  Concept: setInterval + clearInterval

ðŸ”¹ D â†’ Definition:
- `setInterval()` is a built-in JavaScript function that repeatedly calls a function or executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call.
- `clearInterval()` is used to stop the execution set by `setInterval()` using its interval ID.

ðŸ”¹ U â†’ Use Case Scenarios:
- Simulating loading screens or delays
- Real-time clocks or timers
- Repeating tasks like checking server status or notifications

ðŸ”¹ B â†’ Benefits:
- Allows timed repetitive tasks without blocking main execution
- Great for creating delay-based UI feedback
- Easy to control via `clearInterval()`

ðŸ”¹ E â†’ Example (Generic):
Use `setInterval()` to simulate loading, then stop it with `clearInterval()` after a condition is met (like 5 seconds passing).

ðŸ”¹ X â†’ Extra Information:
- The time delay is in milliseconds (1000 ms = 1 sec)
- `setInterval()` doesn't guarantee exact timing due to event loop mechanics
- Always store the returned ID to clear the interval later

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Pairing `setInterval()` with a counter gives you precise control over how long something should repeat.

ðŸŽ¯ You're now playing with timed behavior in JavaScript â€” a key skill for building dynamic UIs!
