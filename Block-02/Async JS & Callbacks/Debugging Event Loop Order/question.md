# ðŸŽ¯ JS Event Loop Debugging â€” Solution

---

## âœ… Problem Recap:
You were given a JavaScript snippet with asynchronous tasks. The goal was to ensure the messages print in the correct logical sequence by understanding the **event loop** in JavaScript.

---

## âœ… Final Code:
```javascript
console.log("Begin");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout Task");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise Task");
});

console.log("End");
```

---

## ðŸ§¾ Output (Correct Sequence):
```
Begin
End
Promise Task
Timeout Task
```

---

## ðŸ§  Why This Order?
This sequence perfectly follows the **JavaScript Event Loop** logic:

| Phase           | Action            | Reason                           |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Call Stack     | Begin             | Sync code always runs first      |
| Call Stack     | End               | Continues after "Begin"          |
| Microtask Queue| Promise Task      | Promises go in microtask queue   |
| Macrotask Queue| Timeout Task      | setTimeout runs after microtasks |

> Even with a delay of `0ms`, `setTimeout` waits until all microtasks are finished â€” that's the magic of the event loop. âœ¨

## ðŸ“˜ Bonus Tip:
Want to test more? Try stacking:
```js
setTimeout(...)
Promise.resolve(...)
queueMicrotask(...)
```
To watch who jumps the line. ðŸ˜‰

ðŸ“Œ **Level Up:** Understanding the event loop gives you a HUGE edge in handling async behavior, especially with `async/await`, `fetch()`, and performance optimization!
