## 💡 Purpose

This assignment is designed to strengthen my understanding of **recursion, DOM manipulation, API integration, and modular JavaScript** through hands-on coding and structured implementation.

As part of my full stack learning roadmap, this builds a solid foundation that will support more advanced projects ahead.

## 🧪 Preview of Code Logic

```javascript
// 📌 Recursion + DOM example: Calculating factorial

function calculateFactorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) return 1;
  return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
}

document.getElementById("calculateBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  const input = document.getElementById("numberInput").value;
  const result = calculateFactorial(Number(input));
  document.getElementById("output").textContent = `Factorial: ${result}`;
});
<!-- 💡 HTML structure -->
<input type="number" id="numberInput" placeholder="Enter a number" />
<button id="calculateBtn">Calculate Factorial</button>
<p id="output"></p>
🧠 This preview showcases recursion, DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interaction in one clean snippet!
