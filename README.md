## 🧪 Preview of Code Logic

```javascript
// 📌 Recursion + DOM example: Calculating factorial

function calculateFactorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) return 1;
  return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
}

document.getElementById("calculateBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  const input = document.getElementById("numberInput").value;
  const result = calculateFactorial(Number(input));
  document.getElementById("output").textContent = `Factorial: ${result}`;
});
